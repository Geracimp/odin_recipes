    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Sisig is a flavorful pork dish originating from the Phillipines.
        It is traditionally made from the "less than desirable" cuts of
        the pig, such as the head and ears and is typically served minced
        with chopped onions and chicken liver on a sizzling cast iron platter.</p>

    <p> In America, it is common to substitute the pig's head and ears for pork
        belly. The meat is marinated in a combination of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic
        and calamansi (a filipino lime) overnight, and then it is slow roasted or smoked
        before being minced and seared on the grill. The result is a savory, sweet and
        tangy flavor that is accentuated by the sourness of calamansi and bite of garlic
        and onion. </p>
