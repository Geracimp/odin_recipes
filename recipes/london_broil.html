    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>A crowd favorite, this easy meat-centric dish is a go-to when you need to feed a large crowd.
        The recipe calls for a large beef top-round steak, which is generally a very reasonably priced
        cut of beef perfect for families on a budget.</p>

    <p>The meat is marinated in a combination of soy sauce and lemon pepper seasoning that gives it 
        a tangy, savory flavor that truly hits. You can serve with any sides you prefer. I like to 
        serve with pan-fried asparagus and a baked potato.</p>
